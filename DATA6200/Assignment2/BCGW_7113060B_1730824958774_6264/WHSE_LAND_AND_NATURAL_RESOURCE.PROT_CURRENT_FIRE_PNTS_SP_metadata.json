Data is supplied through various sources and is updated from the operational systems every 15 minutes.     These points are rolled over to Historical Fire Points on April 1 of each year.\n\nWildfire data may not reflect the most current fire situation, and therefore should only be used for reference purposes. Wildfire data is refreshed when practicable and individual fire update frequency will vary. The information is intended for general purposes only and should not be relied on as accurate because fires are dynamic and circumstances may change quickly.",
